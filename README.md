### Hello everyone
I am new in this area of programming 😭️ and I am trying to improve. Don't except to find cool stuff in my profile yet.

I am currently know some Python and ~starting~ trying to learn Haskell 😵‍💫️.
For later I'm planning to learn a low-level programming language like C or C++.

That is all *for now*.
