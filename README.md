### Hello for you that are reading
I am new in this area of programming 😭️ and I am trying to improve. Don't except to find cool stuff in my profile yet.

I am currently know some Python and trying to learn another programming language 😵‍💫️.
For later I'm planning to learn a low-level programming language like C or C++, or maybe anything web related.

I am a linux user and a [~linux fan~](https://iepe-iaguara.github.io/hyperlinks/index.html) (don't judge me).

That is all for now.
