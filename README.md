### Hello for you that are reading

I am new in this area of programming üò≠Ô∏è and I am trying to improve. Don't except to find cool stuff in my profile yet.


##### What do I know {
I am currently know some Python and Lua.  
I don't know what to do with my knowledge.  
Yes, I know that there is a bunch of things that I can already do now, but I lack creativity.
##### }


##### Why did I started programming {
The idea of controlling computers is the motivation that I had when I started trying programming.  
So for later I'm planning to learn a low-level programming language like C.
##### }


I am a linux user and a [~linux fan~](https://iepe-iaguara.github.io/hyperlinks/index.html) (don't judge me).

That is all for now.
